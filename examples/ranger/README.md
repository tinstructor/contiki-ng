# Advanced Ranger for Zolertia Remote (rev-b)
This document describes the usage and configuration of the ranger example for Contiki-NG. It is designed to work with Zolertia remote-revb nodes. The purpose of the ranger application is to gather as much information about upstream sub-GHz 802.15.4 transmissions in a location within a certain area as possible in a convenient fashion. In other words, a node placed at a predetermined location broadcasts a number of messages that may or may not be received by a number of fixed anchor nodes. From the received packets, the anchor nodes can infer a number of properties about the transmission channel, such as: RSSI, LQI, packet error rate, etc.
